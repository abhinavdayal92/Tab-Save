## Project Files

Hereâ€™s a quick look at the files that make this extension work:

-   `manifest.json`: The most important file. It tells the browser what your extension is, what permissions it needs (`tabs`, `storage`), and where to find its files.
-   `popup.html`: The structure and content of the small pop-up window that appears when you click the extension's icon. It contains the two main buttons.
-   `popup.css`: The stylesheet for the pop-up. It makes the interface look clean and user-friendly with colors, spacing, and fonts.
-   `popup.js`: The JavaScript logic that powers the extension. It handles the button clicks, saves the tab URLs, and restores them.
-   `images/`: This folder holds the icons for the extension (`icon16.png`, `icon48.png`, `icon128.png`).
-   `README.md`: This file! It provides information about the project.

## Technologies Used

This extension is built with fundamental web technologies:

-   **HTML:** For the pop-up structure.
-   **CSS:** For styling the pop-up.
-   **JavaScript:** For the core functionality (saving, closing, and restoring tabs).
